This library is a loose collection of tools to make working with the PSR HTTP stack a bit easier.

## Included tools

### HttpStatus

Yet another Enum listing the different typical HTTP response codes used.

### ResponseBuilder

ResponseBuilder is a simple convenience wrapper around the PSR-17 factory classes.  It provides a single, easy to use "builder" class that produces common PSR-7 response objects types.  You may bring your own PSR-17 factory of your choice.

See the [ResponseBuilder](src/ResponseBuilder.php) class, as its methods should be fairly self-explantory just from their names.

### CacheHeaderMiddleware

This zero-configuration middleware ensures that cache headers are stripped from requests/responses that should not have them, according to the HTTP spec.

### EnforceHeadMiddleware

Ensures that the response to a HEAD request has an empty body, even if one was incorrectly set.

### DefaultContentTypeMiddleware

Allows setting a default `content-type` and `accept` header value on incoming requests.  Useful for APIs that allow clients to not specify those headers, without code further on needing to account for it being missing.
