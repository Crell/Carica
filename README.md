This library is a very simple convenience wrapper around the PSR-17 factory classes.  It provides a single, easy to use "builder" class that produces common PSR-7 response objects types.

See the [ResponseBuilder](src/ResponseBuilder.php) class, as its methods should be fairly self-explantory just from their names.
